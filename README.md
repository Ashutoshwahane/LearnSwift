👨🏽‍💻 Swift Programming Language  from Documentation 👉🏻 https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/

**Swift** is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
Nonetheless, many parts of Swift will be familiar from your experience of developing in C and Objective-C.

# Constants and Variables

Constants and variables associate a name (such as maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or welcomeMessage) 
with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). 
The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
