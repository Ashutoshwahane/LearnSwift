# LearnSwift 

Swift can open doors to the world of coding. In fact, it was designed to be anyone’s first programming language, whether you’re still in school or exploring new career paths.

👨🏽‍💻 Swift Programming Language  from Documentation 👉🏻 https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html

**Swift** is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
Nonetheless, many parts of Swift will be familiar from your experience of developing in C and Objective-C.

# Constants and Variables

Constants and variables associate a name (such as maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or welcomeMessage) 
with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). 
The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

# Basic Operators

An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values. For example, the addition operator (+) adds two numbers, as in let i = 1 + 2, and the logical AND operator (&&) combines two Boolean values, as in if enteredDoorCode && passedRetinaScan.

# Strings and Characters

A string is a series of characters, such as "hello, world" or "albatross". Swift strings are represented by the String type. The contents of a String can be accessed in various ways, including as a collection of Character values.

# Collection Type

Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations
